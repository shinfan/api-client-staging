    # # Ruby Client for Stackdriver Logging API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Stackdriver Logging API][Product Documentation]: The Stackdriver Logging API lets you write log entries and manage your logs, log sinks and logs-based metrics.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable the Stackdriver Logging API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/logging)
    # 3. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Installation
    # ```
    # $ gem install google-cloud-logging
    # ```
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### LoggingServiceV2Client
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/logging"
    #
    # logging_service_v2_client = Google::Cloud::Logging::Logging.new
    # formatted_log_name = Google::Cloud::Logging::V2::LoggingServiceV2Client.log_path(project_id, "test-" + Time.new.to_i.to_s)
    # resource = {}
    # labels = {}
    # entries = []
    # response = logging_service_v2_client.write_log_entries(formatted_log_name, resource, labels, entries)
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Stackdriver Logging API Product documentation][Product Documentation] to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md) to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.
